### MSDS 6306: Doing Data Science Case Study 02
Attrition in business can mean the reduction in staff and employees in a company through normal means, such as retirement and resignation, the loss of customers or clients to old age or growing out of the companyâ€™s target demographic.Changes in management style, company structure, or other aspects of the company might cause employees to leave the company voluntarily, resulting in a higher attrition rate. Another possible cause of attrition is when a company eliminates a job completely. There are different turnover rates across industries, with hospitality and retail having higher rates compared to other industries.

The specific objective of this project is to predict if an employee is going to resign or not.
